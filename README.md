# CaptchaJS

Simple JavaScript library to insert to verify the user isn't a bot without using traditional captcha codes.

# Introduction

Welcome to CaptchaJS, this simple JavaScript library allows you to automatically
insert a hidden captcha code, generated in the user's browser, which lets you
verify the form submitter is a real user and not an automated bot submitting
multiple requests to flood your server or spam your database contents.

# Usage

1: Assign an "id" to your form in this fashion
`<form action="form.php" method="POST" id="FormId">`

2: Change the "FormID" value in the "document.getElementById" below to your chosen form ID above

3: Include the PHP function from the "captchaJS.php" file in your processing and check its return
